### How it works

- You have predefined set of internal docs
- Create a MongoDB instance, either self-hosted or on MongoDB cloud.
- Sign up on the [**Alchemyst Platform**](https://platform.getalchemystai.com)
- Get an [**API Key**](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/settings)
- Upload those docs on the [**Alchemyst Context Surgeon**](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/context).
- Plug the respective environment variables. For BACKEND_BASE_URL, use https://platform-backend.getalchemystai.com
- For the NEXT_BACKEND_URL, use the URL where you will be hosting this template. For development, default is assumed to be http://localhost:4163
- Now let the Alchemyst Platform take care of the rest.

## Benefits

- **Personalized documentation for users**: Users can ask any question they like, and will get answers based on top of your uploaded docs
- **Autopilot SEO for businesses**: Pages are created for your users on the go, and persist in the sitemap, so automatically better SEO content.
